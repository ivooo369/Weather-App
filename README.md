# Weather-App

I developed this weather app project while following The Odin Project's curriculum. This project was created to enhance my understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Assignment

1. Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
2. Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
3. Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
4. Set up a form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
5. Display the information on your webpage!
6. Add any styling you like!
7. Optional: add a 'loading' component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API. Use DevTools to test for low-end devices.
8. Push that baby to github and share your solution below!

## Features:

- Viewing hourly and daily weather forecasts, along with essential weather indicators, for a chosen city (all data fetched from the Weather API);
- Displaying weather information in various units (km/miles and °C/°F);
- Searching for locations using Cyrillic, with automatic translation to English via the MyMemory API;

## Used technologies:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- Webpack;
