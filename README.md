# Weather-App

I developed this weather app project while following The Odin Project's curriculum. This project was created to enhance my understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript.

## Features:

- Viewing hourly and daily weather forecasts, along with essential weather indicators, for a chosen city (all data fetched from the Weather API);
- Displaying weather information in various units (km/miles and °C/°F);
- Searching for locations using Cyrillic, with automatic translation to English via the MyMemory API;

## Used technologies:

- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- Webpack;
